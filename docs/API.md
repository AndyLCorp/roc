# API Reference

This document outlines all the named exports from the main file in Roc. This means that these functions can be considered part of the public API and can be consumed in the following way.

```javscript
// ES5
var merge = require('roc').merge;

## Utilities
These are utility functions that might be useful in mainly extensions.

### `fileExists`
```javascript
import { fileExists } from 'roc';

if (fileExists(path, /* directory */)) {
    // file exist
} else {
    // file does not exist
}
```
Verifies if a file exists. Directory is optional and the path will be made absolute using `getAbsolutePath` meaning that it can be relative.

### `folderExists`
```javascript
import { folderExists } from 'roc';

if (folderExists(path, /* directory */) {
    // folder exist
} else {
    // folder does not exist
}
```
Verifies if a folder exists. Directory is optional and the path will be made absolute using `getAbsolutePath` meaning that it can be relative.

### `generateDependencies`
```javascript
import { generateDependencies } from 'roc';

// To be used inside the Roc object for dependencies.exports and dependencies.uses
export default {
  dependencies: {
    exports: generateDependencies(require('package.json'), [
        'lodash',
        'webpack'
    ]),
    uses: generateDependencies(require('package.json'), [
        'left-pad'
    ])
  }
};
```
To be used when defining dependencies that are either exported or used in an extension. Makes it easier to define the needed data without having to do a lot of manual work.

### `getAbsolutePath`
```javascript
import { getAbsolutePath } from 'roc';

const absPath = getAbsolutePath('./some/path', /* directory */);
```
Makes a path absolute if not already. Takes in a optional directory and will fallback on `process.cwd()`. Will return `undefined` if no path is given.

### `lazyFunctionRequire`
```javascript
import { lazyFunctionRequire } from 'roc';

const lazyRequire = lazyFunctionRequire(require);

roc = {
  actions: [{
    action: lazyRequire('./myAction')
  }]
}
```
Will delay the require of a file that exports a function until it is requested. Recommended to use as a way to speed up loading extensions.

### `merge`
```javascript
import { merge } from 'roc';

const newObject = merge(objA, objB);
```
Will deeply merge two objects together and return a new object.

## `Execute`
__These functions should be seen as experimental and might change without a mayor version change to Roc.__

Roc has a simple implementation of execute that makes it easy to invoke string commands as they would have been invoked through a npm script. Supports binding of  `node_modules` to the _$PATH_ using the options.

__`options`__  
All of the variants of execute takes in the same option object as the second argument.

```js
{
  args: [], // Additional arguments as an array that should be used with the command.
  context: '/some/path', // A path that where a lookup will be done for node_modules/.bin and if found it will be added to the $PATH
  cwd: 'some/path/', // The directory the command should be invoked inside
  silent: true // A boolean that will enable and disable output from the command
}
```

__`ExecuteError`__  
If an error happens in one of the execute functions an `ExecuteError` will be thrown, or in the case of `execute` the promise will be rejected with the error.

It extends the normal `Error` with the following methods.

```
error.getCommand() - The command that was used that caused the problem
error.getExitCode() - The exit code from the process
error.getStderr() - The result from stderr
error.getStdout() - The result from stdout
```

### `execute`
```javascript
import { execute } from 'roc';

execute('git log', options).then(() => {
    // Completed
  })
  .catch((executeError) => {
  });
```
Runs a string in the shell asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves when the command is completed or when a error happened.

### `executeSync`
```javascript
import { executeSync } from 'roc';

const output = executeSync('git log', options);
```
Runs a string in the shell synchronously.

The function will throw if an `ExecuteError` if an error happens.

### `executeSyncExit`
```javascript
import { executeSyncExit } from 'roc';

const output = executeSyncExit('git log', options);
```

A wrapper around `executeSync` with the difference that it will terminate the process if an error happens using the same exit code.

## Configuration

### `appendConfig`
```javascript
import { appendConfig } from 'roc';

const customConfig = {
    property: 'value'
};

const config = appendConfig(customConfig);
```
Appends new configuration to the configuration object after the context has been built.

### `appendSettings`
```javascript
import { appendSettings } from 'roc';

const newSettings = {
    runtime: {
	    port: 80
    }
};

const settings = appendSettings(newSettings);
```
Appends new settings to the settings object after the context has been built.

### `getConfig`
```javascript
import { getConfig } from 'roc';

const config = getConfig();
```
Gets the configuration.

### `getSettings`
```javascript
import { getSettings } from 'roc';

const settings = getSettings();
const runtimeSettings = getSettings('runtime');
```
Gets the settings, possible to specify the first group to select a slice.

## Runtime

### `getResolveRequest`
```javascript
import { getResolveRequest } from 'roc';

// resolver: (module, context, fallback = false) => path
const resolver = getResolveRequest('Identifier');
```
When the runtime has been configured it is possible to get the resolver that Roc uses internally. Using this resolver will resolve in the same way Roc does. Nodeâ€™s `require` will by default be patched and this function can be used to add support for other things like Webpack.

#### `resolver`
The resolver that is returned from `getResolveRequest` has the following arguments.

__`module`__  
The module that is requested, what typically would be X in `require(X)`.

__`context`__  
The context from where the request was done, the file that did the request.

__`fallback`__  
An optional boolean that enables fallback mode, should only be used if the first request failed.

This emulates kinda how `NODE_PATH` works in that we try again with another scope. What this does is that it uses the context of dependencies for the extension that a dependency is installed in to manage possible failures. This is needed if a dependency of an extension requires some peerDependency that some other extension is providing.

### `initRuntime`
```javascript
// Default options
const optionalOptions = {
  verbose: true,
  directory: process.cwd(),
  projectConfigPath: undefined
};

require('roc').runtime(optionalOptions);
```
Used to manually add the Roc runtime. Can also be included from `roc/runtime` and for just using the default options directly one can use `roc/runtime/register`. [See more here.](/docs/Runtime.md#manually-adding-the-runtime)

## Hooks

### `removeActions`
```javascript
import { removeActions } from 'roc';

const newActions = removeActions(actions)('roc-package-example', /* hookName*/);
```
Remove actions from a given state, useful in `init` and `postInit` to remove actions that should no longer run. The first argument on the second function is for what extension to remove the actions for and the second for what hook the actions are connected to.

### `runHook`
```javascript
import { runHook } from 'roc';

const name = require('../../package.json').name;

// Can then be called in the extension like this
// invokeHook('hook-name', arg1, arg2, ...);
// invokeHook('hook-name', arg1, arg2, ...)(callback); - if callback
export function invokeHook(...args) {
    return runHook(name)(...args);
}
```
Runs a hook that have been registered with Roc, often wrapped in extensions as seen above.

### `runHookDirectly`
```javascript
import { runHookDirectly } from 'roc';

runHookDirectly(meta, args, callback);
```
Runs a hook directly, without having to register it first with Roc.

__meta__  
An object with meta data for the hook, [see hooks documentation for more info.](/docs/Hooks.md#hooks)
```
arguments - Arguments definitions
description - A description for what the hook does
extension - For what extension the hook is connected to
initialValue - The initial value for the hook invocation
name - The name of the hook
returns - The validation for the return value from the actions
```

__args__  
The arguments that should be sent to the actions.

__callback__  
The callback that should be invoked after the action returns.

## Others

### `initLog`
```javascript
import { initLog } from 'roc';

// name and version should be for current extension
const largeLog = initLog.large(name, version);
const smallLog = initLog.small();

largeLog.info(message, title);
smallLog.warn(message);
```
Roc exports a logging function that prints to the stdout that can be used in extensions to normalise the output from them with additional benefits like supporting verbose mode.

Can also be imported directly from `roc/log`.

```javascript
import initSmall from 'roc/log/small';
import initLarge from 'roc/log/large';
import initLog from 'roc/log';

import smallDefault from 'roc/log/default/small';
import largeDefault from 'roc/log/default/large';
import initLogDefault from 'roc/log/default';
```

[See logging documentation for all the possible types of messages.](/docs/Logging.md)

### `runCli`
```javascript
import { runCli } from 'roc';

runCli({ info, commands, args, invoke });
```
Be able to invoke the CLI manually. Can be used to create wrappers around the default `roc` CLI and build the same context as was created by Roc with the parsed arguments using invoke as `false`.

__`info`__  
An object that has two properties, `name` and `version`. Should hold the name and the version for the current CLI. Will default to `Unknown` for both.

__`commands`__  
An object with commands that should be used as a base, before additional commands are added from extensions or the default commands that are added if itâ€™s a valid Roc project.

__`args`__  
An array with arguments, will default to `process.argv`.

__`invoke`__  
A boolean that is used to determine ff a command should be invoked after the context has been built or not. Defaults to `true`.
