# `plugins`

## Overview

Defined in the [Roc configuration object](/docs/config/README.md), often referred to as `roc.config.js`, and contains "plugin" defined by the the different packages.

This should be an object but otherwise it's entirely up to the packages on how it should look. For more information please look at the different packages.

## Meta
Meta is used to add descriptions for the plugins and is expected to match the structure of the plugins. Currently this is not used anywhere, but still serves a purpose as a way to document the package plugins.
