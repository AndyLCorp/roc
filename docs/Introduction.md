# Introduction

Roc is a tool that assists with creating web applications. It has the ambitious goal of making it easier to work with modern web development, that at times can be quite complex and requires a lot of tooling and configuration.

Roc itself aims to be as agnostic as possible and uses opinionated extensions to provide different frameworks and libraries along with templates for easy and predictable initial setup. When putting all of this together you get an ecosystem that enables developers to focus on writing great software and away from tooling and juggling boilerplates that degrade over time.
