# Creating a template

A [template](https://github.com/rocjs/roc/blob/master/docs/Templates.md) in Roc is a git repository that contains at least a `package.json` and a `template/` directory. It is also possible to define a `roc.setup.js` or `roc.setup.json` for more control over how the template is instantiated.

For a complete overview over what can be defined in the `roc.setup.js(on)` file [see here](https://github.com/rocjs/roc/blob/master/docs/Templates.md#structure).
